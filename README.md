# Biodiversity in National Parks
This project is a part of Codecademy - Data Science Career Path. Given the data from four national parks in the U.S., the varieties of species and conservation status were analyzed and visualized. The analysis report was also written in order to communicate findings.

# Files Description

- observations.csv - provided dataset which were records of each species' observations in national parks
- species_info.csv - provided dataset which told each species' common names and their conservation status
- merged_data.xlsx - cleaned data which merged 'observations.csv' and 'species_info.csv' together 
- biodiversity-in-national-park.ipynb - a notebook demonstrating how data analyzed and visualized
- Data Analysis Report.pdf - an analysis report to executives and conservationists
